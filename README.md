## Backup to GitHub and Google Drive

Run from the repository on the `main` branch:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

The script stages changes and displays the staged diff. It asks for approval before
committing, pushing to `origin/main` through the existing SSH remote, and syncing
Drive. Answering anything other than `y` cancels the backup (changes remain staged).
No empty commit is created. A failed commit or push stops the backup before Drive.
Approval is also required when there are no new changes to commit.

The existing `.venv` needs these packages. If setting up a new environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-httplib2 httplib2
```

Authentication uses the existing DWD service account file `../secure/google/0.json`
relative to this repository and impersonates `bhoshan.moheeputh@vopak.com`. The Drive
destination is folder `1rwOlHtHd2ogU0Wv5_K454HbmXSGjxYPs`. Keep the credential outside
the repository; the scripts do not modify it or print authentication responses.

Preview the Drive changes in committed `HEAD` without loading credentials, making
API calls, or writing state:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/drive_sync.py
```

To retry just Drive after a successful Git push, run the following and approve its
prompt. Direct Drive runs do not push or verify GitHub:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/drive_sync.py --sync
```

Drive synchronization uses `git diff` from the last successful checkpoint. The
first run considers every tracked file in the current commit, even when the
repository already has commit history, and adopts existing uniquely named Drive
files by ID. Folder structure is preserved. Detected renames retain the file ID;
deleted files remain in Drive. Git renames are detected heuristically: a heavily
rewritten file may be treated as a deletion plus an addition, retaining the old copy.
Unchanged files are not uploaded. Uploads read committed Git blobs, so uncommitted
working tree content is never uploaded by the Drive script.

State is stored at `~/.config/go-web-framework/drive-sync-state.json` with owner-only
permissions. It contains the successful commit, pending commit, Drive IDs, and
completed blob IDs. State updates are atomic and a lock prevents concurrent Drive
runs. The checkpoint advances only when all eligible files succeed. On failure,
rerun the backup or the Drive command: completed uploads are skipped and pending
ones are retried. An interrupted snapshot finishes before newer commits are synced.
Keep this state file during retries; reserved IDs prevent duplicate creates even
when an upload succeeds remotely but its response is lost.

API requests have a 120-second HTTP timeout and up to five attempts with exponential
backoff (1, 2, 4, and 8 seconds) for transient network errors and HTTP 429/5xx.
Ambiguous names, incompatible Drive file types, and unexpected ID conflicts fail
without advancing the checkpoint. Resolve duplicate names in Drive before retrying.
The script never calls Drive's delete API. Each snapshot prints created, updated,
skipped, and failed file counts; folder creation is not included in the file counts.

Only regular Git-tracked source files are eligible. `.env*`, private keys,
credential/secret paths, virtual environments, dependencies, build outputs, common
binary/archive/database artifacts, and recognizable private-key/service-account
content are excluded. Tracked symlinks and submodules are skipped; a working tree
symlink in an otherwise eligible path fails safely. The exclusions are deliberately
conservative and live in `scripts/drive_sync.py`. Review the staged diff for GitHub;
Drive exclusions do not change what Git commits. If Git history is rewritten or
state is corrupt, synchronization stops: restore valid history/state, or archive
the state file and perform a full reconciliation after resolving the cause.

Run the offline tests (temporary Git repositories and mocked Drive responses):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
bash -n backup.sh
```

These tests do not use credentials, contact Google Drive, or push to GitHub.
